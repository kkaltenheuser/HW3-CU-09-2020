Title: Homework Assignment.Three (wk2)

ReadMe: This project was an opportunity to really push and test what I had already learned in HTML + CSS, implementing fresh Javascript knowledge along the way. It 
was built on the basis of typing code and having to scan through debugging what is creating tension in the file; stamina was vital especially since I have never 
worked with Javascript before until now and have found it particularly confusing despite the semantics of the programming language being relatively simple. As a 
young developer, I exist in a constant, fluctuating state of learning and exploration to see how Ican refine and grow my skills. This was especially proven with 
the deployment of Javascript alongside the .CSS and .HTML skills that I have been building and refining, and of course, will continue to build. This 
project\works to address the query it came with, that which is generating a random password for a user to utilize in their daily life; it also works to address 
the unique dance of three different languages coming together to create and generate work that is useful beyond just being appeasing to the skills of a growing
developer. I learned and was continually reminded of the value of stamina when navigating topics that are still clicking, Javascript is an incredible and highly
functional language but it can also be difficult to navigate which is why psuedo coding is so viable and why I broke down the sentence structure in Javascript 
to be simple and semantic. Something I am continually reminded of is that as developers, we are always learning and refining our craft and skill; there is no
“arrival” or “end point” when it comes to knowledge and application of said knowledge. What makes my project stand out is the tenacity and grit that it took as 
I continually toyed with and applied code, there is a great amount of detail and google-fu that went into creating this landscape of code. What makes my project 
stand out is that if someone new were to stumble upon it, they would know where to implement changes were they to evolve the password to a different set of 
variables.
